Food interactions independently associated with cardiometabolic traits beyond dietary patterns across western and eastern populations

Cardiometabolic health is closely linked to diet. Both specific food choices and dietary patterns are commonly used to guide cardiometabolic protection strategies. However, the balance between foods may also significantly impact cardiometabolic health.

Here we explore the balance and imbalance of dietary foods to quantify food interactions (FIs), extending beyond conventional dietary patterns and single food intake frequencies. Using data from the NHANES (n = 7,350) and our GGMP (n = 6,994) cohorts, we observed that food interactions are independent of single food intake frequency and dietary patterns. We identified 1,759 and 306 cardiometabolic-related food interactions (FDR< 0.05), respectively. Notably, around 80% of these interaction-involved foods not individually associated with cardiometabolic traits, and FI associations with cardiometabolic traits at the hyper food group level were consistent across Eastern and Western populations. Besides, mediation analysis revealed that 72.7% of FIs affected cardiometabolic traits through 31 microbial genera, with Clostridiumsensustricto1 playing a predominant role. Moreover, multi-step mediation analysis found that microbes mediated the impact of FIs on cardiometabolic traits primarily through their metabolic pathways, such as pyruvate fermentation to propanoate and ergothioneine biosynthesis pathways.

Our data suggest that balance between dietary foods is broadly associated with cardiometabolic traits by modulating gut microbial functionalities, in contrast to the lower occurrence when considering individual foods in isolation. These results offer a novel perspective for designing personalized dietary strategies beyond present dietary indicators to enhance cardiometabolic health.
